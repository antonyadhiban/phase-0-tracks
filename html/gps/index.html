<!-- What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?

The semantic tags in HTML5 adds more meaning to the html page. It helps for reference and accessibility for disabled people.
The header and footer obviously gives accessibility. The aside tag makes it easier for breezing through the main content.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?

HEADER
BODY
FOOTER

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?

Sublime is a very versatile and flexible tool. Yes, more handy snippets need to be made for each type of need and as we learn more and more we need to be updating the snippets to match our needs.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?

The most difficult thing was that to understand how the browser actually arranged things based on the tags that we put them in. I could improve by browsing the internet or asking my guide(Which i already did.)
