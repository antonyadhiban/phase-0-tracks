# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

  Version control is the maintanence of different versions of your source code. This allows for rollback when an error is made and also to fix the error using messages saved on commit.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

  A branch is a seperate line of work made from the base code that allows us to make changes in the source code without actually affecting it. This allows us to develop different versions and experiment on the code. We merge only branches necessary as a product when combined with the base code.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

  commit is a command that can be compared to a save point. All changes made to files inside the local folder can be saved using commit. A good commit message should have the changes made to files as content and should be recognized by the team of people viewing the message.

* What is a merge conflict?

  A merge conflict occurs when the content in two branches are not the same but it does not occur when one of the workspace is empty.
